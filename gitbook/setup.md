  Before you get started on working with Node-RED you will need to sign up for
  IBM Cloud , set up Node Red and get access to IBM Services
---

# Setup

## Getting Started with IBM Cloud

* [Click Here to Get Started](https://ibm.biz/BdzMZG)

> ### Caution
>
> When many people try to sign up from the same ip such as a public wifi in this workshop environment the system catches that as a spam. Since our lite account also do not have a credit card requirement, that is the best way we have to stop spam accounts being created. It's not perfect. But we would rather give people access to a lite account than force people to connect their credit card.

To avoid getting locked out

* If possible use some sort of hotspot or ask your workshop lead.
* Use incognito window. 
* Use a VPN
