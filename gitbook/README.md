# Twitter Analysis using Node-RED

## Introduction  <a id="lab-instructors"></a>

Social media plays a big role in our communication.Tweets are a great source of information however  historically it has been difficult for computers to make sense of the unstructured data that contained within a  social media feed. But with Watson and AI we can start to make sense of this data.

In this lab we will use Node-RED, a drag and drop low code environment and Watson APIs to do various AI analysis of raw unstructured data to gain useful insight. We will use bunch of services like sentiment analysis, tone analysis, text to speech , and language translator to understand these tweets
